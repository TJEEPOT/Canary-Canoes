### What It Does ###
This is the codebase for my first project, a site coded only in HTML5 and CSS3 from scratch without any templates or external libraries, which were the limitiations given to me. 

### What I Learned ###
To fulfil all the design requirements for this project, I needed to create a site that validated correctly, was easy to navigate with accessibility in mind, was responsive to resizing, embedded external features (such as maps), featured an image gallery, embedded social media links and ensure it ran the same in all modern browsers.
