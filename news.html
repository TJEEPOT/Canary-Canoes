						<div class="fTCell"><h6>26 January 2017</h6></div>
						<div class="fTCell"><p>Almost a hundred paddlers took to the River Roding on Sunday for our home race. Although it was cold, the 
						weather was kind and conditions were good for racing. It seemed fitting that our race was the first in the calendar after the 
						sad passing of one of our members, Steve Truglia. A moving tribute was held as everyone took a moment to remember Steve before 
						taking to the water.</p>
						<p>Overall it was a good day for us on the water, with podium finishes in a variety of classes. Our mixed junior K2 crew of Romeo 
						Balla and Dannielle Clifford took their second win of the series. Also making it two wins out of two in the series was Trish 
						True in the female GPO class.</p>

						<div class="fTCell"><h6>9th November, 2016</h6></div>
						<div class="fTCell"><p>Our JACKS weekend is done and dusted but the memories of the trip will stick with us forever.
						As Smurfs, Saints and Sailors walking down Western Road Friday afternoon we kept the head down and tried to ignore the odd looks we all
						received until we met the other 55 people who were dressed as ridiculously as we were. All in good spirit and a brilliant way to start 
						a memorable weekend. The bus up was an enjoyable one with brilliant mingling of Oldies and freshers alike before we arrived at the 
						hostel and got to know eachother some more over the night.</p>
						<p>On the Saturday morning we awoke and left the hostel to paddle the Castleconnell river. This is a brilliant river for kayakers and all 
						of the paddlers thoroughly enjoyed their spin down the river. Many fresher kayakers paddled their first ever river and did fantastically 
						well and they were delighted to see their weeks of hard work paying off.</p>

						<div class="fTCell"><h6>12 June 2016</h6></div>
						<div class="fTCell"><p>This year’s Hasler marathon race was a record-breaker. We had 213 competitors out on the water – more than 
						ever before – and around 50 of them were Royal club members. That was a big showing for the home team. And they didn’t disappoint</p>
						<p>Club Commodore Jon Boyton was first off in Division 1 K1. Racing over the 12 mile course and lining up against some of the country’s 
						top marathon paddlers, Jon was never in for an easy race. But, with just two portages and feeling at home on the familiar water, he took 
						victory by 2 seconds – a respectable margin for a sprint finish at this level.</p>

						<div class="fTCell"><h6>30 January 2016</h6></div>
						<div class="fTCell"><p>Today, it was Chelmsford’s turn to host the 5th race in the Flatwater Winter Series with a fantastic turnout. 
						Almost 150 competitors participated over 2 separate starts. Classes 13-21 with a total of 37 paddlers set off at 11am with the 
						remaining classes setting off at 12pm.</p>
						<p>After a freezing spell over the last week and problems with frozen locks, today was mild in comparison. The rain held off and 
						conditions were good. The decision was made to race through the town. It was certainly interesting navigating the wash through 
						the first part of the race!</p>
						<p>There were a few podium finishes for us. Fortunately for me, Trish True, in the female GP, there were no 
						portages and I achieved my 3rd Gold medal of the series and maintained my position of first place overall.</p>
